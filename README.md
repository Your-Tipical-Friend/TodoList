# TodoList
This is an uncomplete personal project to help me track my time and maybe, boost my productivity.

This is a To-Do list app with multiple features, made with Flutter.

# The features I am trying to add are:

1-) daily and weekly todo lists that erase itself at 08:00 and on the weekend respectively. and make a score for how much productivity that day/week has.

2-) a note's keeper that has a reminder built on it, it remind you every hour or every 12 hours or once every 3 days or once a week or maybe never.

3-) this is by far the hardest feature; i want to make it social, like challenging people to have their todo list all crossed.
